Bugs\nüêû Test DB nightmare\nEarly on, tests kept failing even though they used a separate sqlite database. turned out they were accidentally connecting to the dev postgres container‚Äîresulting in state bleed and weird errors.\nfix: I updated the test setup to fully isolate the sqlite test DB, and cleaned stale containers using make down.\nlesson: To double-check your test environment assumptions.\n\nüêû Strategy returns ‚Äú0 trades‚Äù\nMy tests expected a buy signal‚Äîbut the logic returned nothing.\nfix: Turns out my strategy only counts full trades (buy + sell). the test data had a buy signal, but no corresponding sell. I had to redesign the test to simulate a full market cycle.\nlesson: Test data should reflect the exact logic you‚Äôre testing‚Äînot just part of it.\n\nReflections ~\nThis project taught me a lot‚Äînot just about FastAPI, Docker, or (specially)pandas‚Äîbut about treating small assignments like real systems. the biggest win wasn‚Äôt just getting it to work, but making it clean, testable, and explainable.\n\nVisuals\n\nThere is a live recorded demo in the GitHub Repo as well!\n\nraw data\n\n\nthe raw data in the endpoint `/data`\n\n\nstrategy performance\n\n\npreview of the `/strategy/performance` endpoint\n\n\ntest coverage\n\n\ntests report\n\n\nsource code\nCheck out the full code, project structure, and setup instructions here:\ngithub.com/ryu-ryuk/inv\n","path":null},{"url":"https://blogs.alokranjan.me/blog/intro/","title":"who tis the?","description":null,"body":"intro\nlet‚Äôs get to it now.
