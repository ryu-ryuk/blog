I am a **backend engineer**, a **ricer**, and a to-be **cybersecurity specialist** and a lot more ;) .

## dislikes:
- people who skip the `man` page
- messy code and unstructured repos
- bloated software with zero config options
- vague bug reports and unclear commit messages

## when i’m not coding:
- playing badminton or walking (indeed, I do touch grass)  
- exploring reverse-engineering
- reading about infosec or learning about DevOps  
- rewriting the same scripts until it feels right
