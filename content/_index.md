# ryu ~

a backend engineer, system ricer, and phonk-fueled night coder.  
often found tweaking dotfiles at 2am with a cat on the lap and a snack in hand.

---

likes:
- cats. everywhere. all the time.
- midnight snacks and coffee that hits hard
- phonk and lo-fi for long coding sessions
- good documentation — if it's not documented, it doesn't exist
- ricing machines to perfection (wm, fonts, colors, everything)
- minimal, efficient cli tools that just work

dislikes:
- people who skip the `man` page
- messy code and unstructured repos
- bloated software with zero config options
- vague bug reports and unclear commit messages
- using the mouse too much

---

tools of choice:
- neovim + tmux
- zsh + starship
- arch btw (tiled wm gang)
- python, go, rust
- fastapi, docker, postgres, traefik

---

when i’m not coding:
- playing badminton  
- reverse-engineering random stuff  
- reading about infosec or messing with devops pipelines  
- rewriting the same script until it feels right
